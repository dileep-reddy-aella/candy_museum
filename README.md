# MUSEUM OF CANDY

* This is website for a museum where people can see different varities of candy's.
* I wanted to show case that I can use both Bootstrap and pure CSS to style a web page.
* The styling of the home page was done using Bootstrap.
* Once you click on the tickets button. It'll take you to another page where you can purchase tickets to visit the museum.
* Tickets page is styled using pure CSS.
* It is a responive website and can align the contents according to the screen size.
